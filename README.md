# CV_proj
Current Python-based personal project I am working on to practice and learn new Computer Vision concepts. 

##Goal: Design and create a wearable HUD(Heads-up Display) for navigation directions. 
<br>
### Current implementation: 
System is 100% software based. 
Planning on using ML to detect user's position based on road+building+street signs as well as Google Maps API
In the long run, this might not be super accurate. So the introduction of an IMU and GPS for coordinate data + orientation might be necessary
<br> 
Image filtering functions done in filtering.py. 
I have transitioned to using library functions instead of using my own algorithms, so filtering.py might need to be removed in the future.
<br> 
##To Run: 
clone the repo
install required libraries: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`	
run idk.py file
